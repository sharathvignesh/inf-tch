            A common first step toward the Internet of Things is recognizing all objects uniquely through sensors. Unlike other app development projects, IoT is a little different. Instead of just a front-end and backend, there is usually a smart device (hardware), front-end app and the communication platform. With our comprehensive IOT development service offerings, we can help you with prototyping of hardware design, build the backend layer, and the user-facing app.

            Our IoT developers can help in building solutions to connect users with environmental data gathered by sensors, controlling devices through the Internet, and creating smart products and services. Our IoT development services include hardware prototyping and circuit designs, backend design, and development of user-facing apps on iOS, Android and other mobile platforms. Add to that, the minimum complexity and cost associated with piecing together solutions from multiple vendors.
